# MandelbrotRenderer
Outputs a Bitmap file containing a render of the Mandelbrot set.

To use: Run the program and when prompted enter the desired width and height of the output image as well as the number of iterations you would like to be used (Use 100 if you're not sure what this means).

Plans for the future: The ability to let the user zoom into the set, change where the camera is focused and to choose their own colour scheme.
